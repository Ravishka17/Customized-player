IT PROVIDES ME
WITH EXTRA AIR.

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:27.638
THIS DOME IS MADE OF THE
STRONGEST POLYURETHANE;

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.740
THAT'S A FANCY NAME
FOR PLASTIC.

00:18:29.843 --> 00:18:31.676
AIN'T THAT JUST
THE BEE'S KNEES?

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:34.912

00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:42.720
...THAT'S MY TREADMILL.

00:18:42.822 --> 00:18:45.189
THAT'S HOW I STAY
IN TIPTOP SHAPE.

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.190
OH, COME ON.

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.925

00:18:58.872 --> 00:19:00.905
( gasps )

00:19:04.777 --> 00:19:07.612
I BROUGHT YOU SOME FLOWERS.

00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:09.580

00:19:20.426 --> 00:19:22.193
I'M OKAY.

00:19:22.295 --> 00:19:25.730
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE THE FIRST
SEA CRITTER TO EVER VISIT.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:28.566
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.468
CAN I GET

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.504
WATER WOULD BE NICE.

00:19:33.606 --> 00:19:35.740
I'M GOING TO PUT

00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:41.913
( gasping )

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:49.921
I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

00:19:50.023 --> 00:19:51.956
Sandy:
I LIKE YOU, SPONGEBOB.

00:19:52.058 --> 00:19:55.993
WE COULD BE TIGHTER THAN BARK
ON A TREE.

00:19:56.095 --> 00:19:59.931
Patrick:
WHEN IN DOUBT, PINKY OUT.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:04.068
I DON'T NEED WATER.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.204
WATER IS FOR QUITTERS.

00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:08.206
I DON'T NEED IT.

00:20:08.308 --> 00:20:09.807
I DON'T NEED IT.

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:10.975
I DON'T NEED IT.

00:20:11.077 --> 00:20:14.245
I DON'T NEED IT,
I DON'T NEED IT.

00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:18.416
WHY, THESE FLOWERS
ARE JUST BEAUTIFUL.

00:20:18.518 --> 00:20:20.718
THEY'LL LIVE MUCH, MUCH LONGER

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.356
IN A VASE FULL
OF ICE-COLD WATER.

00:20:25.458 --> 00:20:26.624
SO TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:30.294
IT MUST BE FASCINATING
BEING A SEA CRITTER.

00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:34.765
SPONGEBOB?

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:36.267
( timer dings )

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:37.935
OH, THERE'S THE COOKIES.

00:20:38.037 --> 00:20:39.670
BE RIGHT BACK.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.643
SpongeBob ( thinking ):
I DON'T NEED IT.

00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:46.811
I DON'T NEED IT.

00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:51.015
I DEFINITELY DON'T NEED IT.

00:20:51.117 --> 00:20:52.683
I DON'T NEED IT.

00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:54.285
I DON'T NEED IT.

00:20:54.387 --> 00:20:55.620
I DON'T NEED IT.

00:20:55.722 --> 00:20:57.255
I DON'T NEED IT.

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:03.628
( howling ):
I NEED IT!

00:21:05.064 --> 00:21:07.365
( wheezing )

00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:08.399
NO, SPONGEBOB!

00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:09.400
NO, NO, NO!

00:21:09.502 --> 00:21:11.002
STOP!

00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:13.537
PINKY, PINKY!

00:21:16.643 --> 00:21:19.477
( yelling ):
I'M A QUITTER!

00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:21.345
( SpongeBob wailing )

00:21:25.685 --> 00:21:27.585
YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:28.686
YOU'LL BLOW IT.

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:31.489
AIR IS NOT GOOD, PATRICK.

00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:33.691
AIR IS NOT GOOD.

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:37.828
YOU'RE JUST BEING SHY.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.297
DON'T WORRY, BUDDY.

00:21:39.399 --> 00:21:41.265
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

00:21:41.367 --> 00:21:42.833
( panting heavily )

00:21:42.935 --> 00:21:45.503
I WON'T LET YOU BLOW... THIS.

00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:47.004
( wheezing )

00:21:48.441 --> 00:21:49.607
( gagging )

00:21:54.947 --> 00:21:58.949
WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS?!

00:21:59.052 --> 00:22:01.986
THERE'S NO WATER IN HERE!

00:22:02.088 --> 00:22:04.322
I TRIED
TO TELL YOU.

00:22:04.424 --> 00:22:07.725
WE GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE!

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:10.861
YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.

00:22:10.963 --> 00:22:14.365
WAIT, NO,
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT.

00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:16.934
( door opens, closes )

00:22:17.036 --> 00:22:18.135
COME AND GET IT.

00:22:18.237 --> 00:22:20.504
YOU'RE ALL GOING TO LIKE THIS--

00:22:20.606 --> 00:22:21.539
( shrieks )

00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:25.076
( glasses breaking )

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:30.081
THERE.

00:22:30.183 --> 00:22:31.415
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

00:22:31.517 --> 00:22:36.520
IF YOU ALL NEEDED WATER,
YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED.

00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:38.389
I PROPOSE A TOAST:

00:22:38.491 --> 00:22:41.058
TO NEW FRIENDS!

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:46.130
HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:22:46.232 --> 00:22:49.033
I HOPE YOU ALL LIKE
YOUR TEA STRONG.

00:22:49.135 --> 00:22:51.769
DRINK UP!

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.140
( both slurping )

00:22:56.242 --> 00:22:59.543
All:
AH!
